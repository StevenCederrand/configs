# My Personal .config Files

Here is my different .configs. Feel free to do whatever you want with them. 
I mainly use a mac, take that into considerations. 

My nvim uses web-dev-icons, sadly I was unable to get nerd-fonts to work 
with windows terminal. So recommend this setup only for a unix-terminal
