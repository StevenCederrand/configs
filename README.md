# nvim/vim config files

Basic but functional configs that turns vim from a regular text editor, to a proper IDE.

Quite young, but functional.<br>
__Note:__ this has only been tested on a mac. Will need to revise over how functional it is on linux. Windows is another can of worms that I don't feel like touching.
